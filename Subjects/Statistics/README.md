# <p style="text-align:center;">**Statistics**</p>  
#### Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It is a mathematical discipline to collect, summarize data. Also, statistics is a branch of applied mathematics.

#### Mathematical statistics is the application of Mathematics to Statistics that is used for different analytics include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equation and measure-theoretic probability theory.
## Types of Statistics
#### Basically, there are two types of statistics.

   1. Descriptive Statistics
   2. Inferential Statistics
## Descriptive Statistics - 
1. Analyzing, summarizing, organising, representing, and explaining a set of data using charts, graphs, and summary measures.
2. examples- Bar plot, pie charts, histogram, PDF( Probability Density Function ), CDF( Cumulative Distribution Function ), Normal Distribution.
3. Measure of central tendency ( Mean, Median, Mode ).
4. Measure of variance ( Standard Deviation, Variance ).
5. The data we are working with here, can be population data or sample data.

## Inferential Statistics - 
1. Inferential statistics is used to convey the meaning of the collected data after it has been collected, evaluated, and summarised.
2. The probability principle is used in inferential statistics to determine if patterns found in a study sample may be extrapolated to the wider population from which the sample was drawn.
3. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses and study correlations between variables, and they can also be used to predict population sizes.
4. Inferential statistics are used to derive conclusions and inferences from samples, i.e. to create accurate generalisations.
5. examples - Z test, T test, Chi Square test
## Types of Data

1. Qualitative data- Descriptive data.
        Example- She can run fast, He is thin.
2. Quantitative data- Numerical information.
        Example- An Octopus is an Eight legged creature.

## Types of quantitative data

1. Discrete data- has a particular fixed value. It can be counted
2. Continuous data- is not fixed but has a range of data. It can be measured.
## Representation of Data
#### The general representations of statistical data are:

   - Bar Graph
   - Circle Graph / Pie Chart
   - Line Graph
   - Pictograph
   - Histogram
   - Frequency Distribution        etc.

## Measures of Central Tendency

#### In Mathematics, statistics are used to describe the central tendencies of the grouped and ungrouped data. The three measures of central tendency are:

   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode

#### All three measures of central tendency are used to find the central value of the set of data.

### <b><ins>Mean</ins></b> 
#### Mean is the average of of the given numbers and is calculated by dividing the sum of given numbers by the total number of numbers.
#### For a dataset with n values $x_1, x_2, x_3, ……, x_n$ the mean μ is given by:
#### $μ = {\bar{X}} = (1/n)(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)$
#### Example: for the following data set: {2, 4, 6, 7, 10}:
#### $μ = (2 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 10)/5 = 29/5 = 5.8$

### <b><ins>Median</ins></b> 
#### A median is the middle number in a sorted list of either ascending or descending numbers. The numbers must first be sorted or arranged in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest to determine the median value in a sequence. 
#### Example: for the following data set: {2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 2, 44, 6, 17, 22, 5}
#### Sorted order of the data set becomes {2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 10, 17, 22, 44}
#### The median is the middle number in the sorted list, which is 6.

### <b><ins>Mode</ins></b>
#### The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.
#### Example: for the previous data set: {2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 2, 44, 6, 17, 22, 5}, the mode is 2 and 6 because they both appear more than once in the data set.

## Measures of Dispersion

#### In statistics, the dispersion measures help interpret data variability, i.e. to understand how homogenous or heterogeneous the data is or how squeezed or scattered the variable is.

### Absolute measures of dispersion - 

   - Range
   - Variance
   - Standard deviation
   - Quartiles and Quartile deviation
   - Mean and Mean deviation

### Relative measures of dispersion

   - Co-efficient of Range
   - Co-efficient of Variation
   - Co-efficient of Standard Deviation
   - Co-efficient of Quartile Deviation
   - Co-efficient of Mean Deviation

## Skewness -

#### Skewness, in statistics, is a measure of the asymmetry in a probability distribution. It measures the deviation of the curve of the normal distribution for a given set of data. 

## ANOVA Statistics - 

#### ANOVA Stands for Analysis of Variance. It is a collection of statistical models, used to measure the mean difference for the given set of data.

## Degrees of freedom

#### In statistical analysis, the degree of freedom is used for the values that are free to change. The independent data or information that can be moved while estimating a parameter is the degree of freedom of information.

## Population -
#### In statistics, the population is the entire set of items from which data is drawn in the statistical study. It can be a group of individuals or a set of items. It can be large or small depending on the scope of the data. For example, all students in a school or all people in a country. The population is usually denoted by **N**.

## Sample -
#### A sample is a subset of the population selected, which offers a more feasible approach to studying populations. It is a representative portion of the population from which we collect data in order to make inferences or draw conclusions about the entire population based on smaller, manageable datasets. The sample is denoted by **n**.

### Population Mean - 
#### The population mean is defined by μ. It’s formula is ,

#### $μ = (1/N)(\sum_{i=1}^N h_i)$, N= Number of elements in population.

### Sample Mean - 
#### The sample mean is defined by ${\bar{X}}$. It’s formula is ,

#### ${\bar{X}} = (1/n)(\sum_{i=1}^n h_i)$, n= Number of elements in sample.

#### Population Mean >> Sample Mean
#### Sample Mean gets close to Population Mean. as Sample data size increases.

#### Ideally, a sample should be randomly selected and representative of the population. Using probability sampling methods (such as simple random sampling or stratified sampling) reduces the risk of sampling bias and enhances both internal and external validity.

#### For practical reasons, researchers often use non-probability sampling methods. Non-probability samples are chosen for specific criteria; they may be more convenient or cheaper to access. Because of non-random selection methods, any statistical inferences about the broader population will be weaker than with a probability sample.

## Population parameter and Sample statistic -
#### A parameter is a measure that describes the whole population. A statistic is a measure that describes the sample.

## Sampling error -
#### A sampling error is the difference between a population parameter and a sample statistic. Sampling errors happen even when you use a randomly selected sample. This is because random samples are not identical to the population in terms of numerical measures like means and standard deviations.

## Random Variable --
#### Random variable in statistics is a function that assigns a real value to an outcome in the sample space of a random experiment. Random Variable Probability is a mathematical concept that assigns numerical values to outcomes of a sample space. They can describe the outcomes of objective randomness (like tossing a coin) or subjective randomness(results of a cricket game).
#### Mathematically, Random variable is expressed as -
#### **X** : **S** &rarr; **R**, where X is Random Variable, S is Sample Space, R is Set of Real Numbers
#### Suppose a random variable X takes m different values or sample spaces, then
#### $X = {x_1, x_2, x_3………x_m}$ with probabilities
#### $P(X = x_i) = p_i$
#### where 1 ≤ i ≤ m
#### The probabilities must satisfy the following conditions :
#### $0 ≤ p_i ≤ 1$ where $1 ≤ i ≤ m$
#### $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + ……. + p_m = 1$ or we can say $0 ≤ p_i ≤ 1$ and $∑p_i = 1$

#### [ Sample Space - Sample Space is a set of all possible  unique outcomes of a random experiment.
####   Event - The subset of possible outcomes of an experiment is called events.  
####   Example - When rolling a six-sided die, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. In a coin toss, the sample space is {Heads, Tails}.                   ]
#### Sample space of three coin tossing -

#### Here the sample space is {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT} 
#### Let, X represents represents the number of heads that occur.

#### X = {0, 1, 2, 3} where m = 4

#### P(X = 0) = $p_1$ = (Probability 0 that none are heads) = P(TTT) = 1/2×1/2×1/2 = 1/8
#### P(X = 1)  = $p_2$ = (Probability 1 that atleast 1 is heads) = P(HTT | THT | TTH) = 1/2×1/2×1/2 + 1/2×1/2×1/2 + 1/2×1/2×1/2 = 3/8
#### P(X = 2)  = $p_3$ = (Probability 2 that atleast 2 are heads) = P(HHT | HTH | THH) = 1/2×1/2×1/2 + 1/2×1/2×1/2 + 1/2×1/2×1/2 = 3/8
#### P(X = 3)  = $p_4$ = (Probability 3 that all 3 are heads) = P(HHH) = 1/2×1/2×1/2 = 1/8
#### $Here, as, (0 ≤ p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 ≤ 1/2)$ ,

#### $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 1/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 1/8 = 1$
## Types of Random Variable

#### Random variables are of two types that are,

   - Discrete Random Variable
   - Continuous Random Variable

## Discrete Random Variable -
